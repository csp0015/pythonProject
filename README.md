# CPSC4970 Python Final Project
This is my final project for CPSC4970 Python class. This project contains all the python classes for a Curling League Manager and a user iterface system. The user interface system provides functionality to create leagues, create teams within those leagues, and create team members within those teams. It also allows for file upload for an entire league database or team database. You can also save your team or league database into a file.

Tools:
Python
PyQT5

Check requirements.txt for the full list and versions of packages needed

Running this project:

1) Using your IDE make sure you have all requirements downloaded.
2) Download all files/hierarchy from csp0015 Auburn-CPSC4970---Python---Final-Project.
3) Open project in your IDE.
4) Run Main_Window.py to run the Curling League Manager GUI.
5) If you want to save files from the GUI, save database data in the databaseFiles directory and team data in the leagueFiles directory.

Note:
If you run into problems running the python code, select the league directory and right click. Find the option 'Mark Directory as' and hover over to bring up the options and select 'Sources Root'
